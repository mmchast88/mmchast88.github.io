<p>My name is Morgan Chastain, I am 29 years old. I am originally from Greensboro, North Carolina.  I moved back to the DC metro area about two years ago. I went to college at East Carolina University for an undergraduate degree in Healthcare Administration.  I went back to school to obtain a Master's degree in Health Informatics (Health IT) at George Mason University.  I am currently working as a Systems Analyst at a Non- Profit Pediatric Clinic in Fairfax.  I previously worked as a Systems Analyst at Johns Hopkins Health System in Baltimore, MD.</p>
